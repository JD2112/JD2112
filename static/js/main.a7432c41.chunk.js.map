The aim of this study was to decipher proteomic differences between the subsets in healthy individuals, hypothesizing that Olfm4-H neutrophils have a proteomic profile distinct from that of Olfm4 low (Olfm4-L) neutrophils. We then extended the investigation to septic shock. A novel protocol for the preparation of fixed, antibody-stained, and sorted neutrophils for LC-MS/MS was developed. In healthy individuals, 39 proteins showed increased abundance in Olfm4-H, including the small GTPases Rab3d and Rab11a. In Olfm4-L, 52 proteins including neutrophil defensin alpha 4, CXCR1, Rab3a, and S100-A7 were more abundant. The data suggest differences in important neutrophil proteins that might impact immunological processes. However, in vitro experiments revealed no apparent difference in the ability to control bacteria nor produce oxygen radicals. In subsets isolated from patients with septic shock, 24 proteins including cytochrome b-245 chaperone 1 had significantly higher abundance in Olfm4-H and 30 in Olfm4-L, including Fc receptor proteins. There was no correlation between Olfm4-H proportion and septic shock severity, but plasma Olfm4 concentration was elevated in septic shock. Thus, the Olfm4-H and Olfm4-L neutrophils have different proteomic profiles, but there was no evident functional significance of the differences in septic shock.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Id\": 17,\n      \"Year\": 2023,\n      \"Authors\": \"Shahin H, Abdallah S, Das J, He W, El-Serafi I, Steinvall I, Sjöberg F, Elmasry M, El-Serafi AT\",\n      \"Title\": \"miRNome and Proteome Profiling of Human Keratinocytes and Adipose Derived Stem Cells Proposed miRNA-Mediated Regulations of Epidermal Growth Factor and Interleukin 1-Alpha\",\n      \"Journal\": \"International Journal of Molecular Sciences\",\n      \"Number\": \"24 (5), 4956\",\n      \"Citation\": 1,\n      \"DOI\": \"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24054956\",\n      \"Abstract\": \"Wound healing is regulated by complex crosstalk between keratinocytes and other cell types, including stem cells. In this study, a 7-day direct co-culture model of human keratinocytes and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) was proposed to study the interaction between the two cell types, in order to identify regulators of ADSCs differentiation toward the epidermal lineage. As major mediators of cell communication, miRNome and proteome profiles in cell lysates of cultured human keratinocytes and ADSCs were explored through experimental and computational analyses. GeneChip® miRNA microarray, identified 378 differentially expressed miRNAs; of these, 114 miRNAs were upregulated and 264 miRNAs were downregulated in keratinocytes. According to miRNA target prediction databases and the Expression Atlas database, 109 skin-related genes were obtained. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed 14 pathways including vesicle-mediated transport, signaling by interleukin, and others.

This could be validated by experiments showing that phagocytosis of mycobacteria, which is an event preceding mycobacteria-induced IL-1β production, was strongly correlated with the DMG pattern.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Id\": 9,\n      \"Year\": 2018,\n      \"Authors\": \"K Sen, D Bhattacharyya, A Sarkar, J Das, N Maji, M Basu, Z Ghosh, ...\",\n      \"Title\": \"Exploring the major cross-talking edges of competitive endogenous RNA networks in human Chronic and Acute Myeloid Leukemia\",\n      \"Journal\": \"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)-General Subjects\",\n      \"Number\": \"1862 (9), 1883-1892\",\n      \"Citation\": 6,\n      \"DOI\": \"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2018.06.002\",\n      \"Abstract\": \"Human Chronic and Acute Myeloid Leukemia are myeloproliferative disorders in myeloid lineage of blood cells characterized by accumulation of aberrant white blood cells. In cancer, the anomalous transcriptome includes deregulated expression of non-coding RNAs in conjunction with protein-coding mRNAs in human genome. The coding or non-coding RNA transcripts harboring miRNA-binding sites can converse with and regulate each other by explicitly contending for a limited pool of shared miRNAs and act as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). An unifying hypothesis attributing ‘modulation of expression of transcripts’ in this fashion had been defined as ‘competitive endogenous RNA hypothesis’. Network built with ceRNAs evidently offers a platform to elucidate complex regulatory interactions at post-transcriptional level in human cancers.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Id\": 2,\n      \"Year\": 2014,\n      \"Authors\": \"J Das, S Podder, TC Ghosh\",\n      \"Title\": \"Insights into the miRNA regulations in human disease genes\",\n      \"Journal\": \"BMC genomics\",\n      \"Number\": \"15 (1), 1-7\",\n      \"Citation\": 44,\n      \"DOI\": \"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-15-1010\",\n      \"Abstract\": \"MicroRNAs are a class of short non-coding RNAs derived from either cellular or viral transcripts that act post-transcriptionally to regulate mRNA stability and translation. In recent days, increasing numbers of miRNAs have been shown to be involved in the development and progression of a variety of diseases. We, therefore, intend to enumerate miRNA targets in several known disease classes to explore the degree of miRNA regulations on them which is unexplored till date. Here, we noticed that miRNA hits in cancer genes are remarkably higher than other diseases in human. Our observation suggests that UTRs and the transcript length of cancer related genes have a significant contribution in higher susceptibility to miRNA regulation. Moreover, gene duplication, mRNA stability, AREScores and evolutionary rate were likely to have implications for more miRNA targeting on cancer genes. Consequently, the regression analysis have confirmed that the AREScores plays most important role in detecting miRNA targets on disease genes. Interestingly, we observed that epigenetic modifications like CpG methylation and histone modification are less effective than miRNA regulations in controlling the gene expression of cancer genes. The intrinsic properties of cancer genes studied here, for higher miRNA targeting will enhance the knowledge on cancer gene regulation.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Id\": 8,\n      \"Year\": 2013,\n      \"Authors\": \"J Das, S Chakraborty, S Podder, TC Ghosh\",\n      \"Title\": \"Complex-forming proteins escape the robust regulations of miRNA in human\",\n      \"Journal\": \"FEBS letters\",\n      \"Number\": \"587 (14), 2284-2287\",\n      \"Citation\": 8,\n      \"DOI\": \"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2013.05.062\",\n      \"Abstract\": \"Most proteins carry out their functions by participating in protein complexes.

Moreover, the numbers of miRNA hits cannot direct the evolutionary fate of complex-forming proteins independently.

The availability of codominant molecular markers and saturated genetic linkage maps have been limited in foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.). Here, we describe the development of 98 novel intron length polymorphic (ILP) markers in foxtail millet using sequence information of the model plant rice. A total of 575 nonredundant expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences were obtained, of which 327 and 248 unique sequences were from dehydration- and salinity-stressed suppression subtractive hybridization libraries, respectively. The BLAST analysis of 98 EST sequences suggests a nearly defined function for about 64% of them, and they were grouped into 11 different functional categories. All 98 ILP primer pairs showed a high level of cross-species amplification in two millets and two nonmillets species ranging from 90% to 100%, with a mean of ∼97%. The mean observed heterozygosity and Nei’s average gene diversity 0.016 and 0.171, respectively, established the efficiency of the ILP markers for distinguishing the foxtail millet accessions. Based on 26 ILP markers, a reasonable dendrogram of 45 foxtail millet accessions was constructed, demonstrating the utility of ILP markers in germplasm characterizations and genomic relationships in millets and nonmillets species.\"\n    }\n  ];","import React from 'react';\nimport { publication } from './pubcationlist.js';\nimport '../publication.css';\n\nconst Publications = () => {\n  const listYear = publication.map(publi =>\n    <li key={publi.Id}>\n    <p>  \n    <h5>{publi.Authors + ' ' }\n     ({publi.Year}) \n     { ' ' + publi.Title  + ', '}\n     {publi.Journal} \n     {', '+ publi.Number + '.
